## Project Introduction

**Pennysia AMM V1-Periphery** is the user-facing layer of the Pennysia protocol, providing a universal Router contract, utility libraries, and interfaces for seamless integration with the [Pennysia v1-core](https://github.com/Pennysia/v1-core) AMM. **Note:** v1-core and v1-periphery are maintained in separate GitHub repositories for modularity and clarity. This package is ideal for frontend developers, integrators, and anyone building on top of the Pennysia AMM.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Universal Router**:  
  - Add/remove liquidity, swap, and interact with the core Market contract via a single interface.
  - Handles slippage, deadlines, and native/ETH sweeping.
- **Composable Libraries**:  
  - `RouterLibrary` for safe math, path routing, quoting, and validation.
  - `TransferHelper` for safe ERC20 and ETH transfers.
- **Interface-Driven**:  
  - Clean, extensible interfaces for routers, markets, liquidity tokens, and payments.
- **Security-First**:  
  - Deadline enforcement, slippage checks, and safe transfer patterns.
- **Plug-and-Play**:  
  - Designed for integration with the v1-core Market and custom frontends.

## 🤝 How It Integrates with v1-core

Pennysia's **v1-periphery** is designed to work seamlessly with the [**Pennysia v1-core**](https://github.com/Pennysia/v1-core) package, which contains the core AMM logic in `Market.sol` and its supporting libraries and interfaces. **These are separate repositories:**
- v1-core: [https://github.com/Pennysia/v1-core](https://github.com/Pennysia/v1-core)
- v1-core README: [https://github.com/Pennysia/v1-core/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/Pennysia/v1-core/blob/main/README.md)

- **Router as the Gateway:**
  - The `Router` contract in v1-periphery acts as the main entry point for users and frontends.
  - It delegates all core AMM operations (add/remove liquidity, swaps, payment callbacks) to the singleton `Market` contract in v1-core.

- **Interface-Driven Integration:**
  - v1-periphery imports and uses the interfaces from v1-core (`IMarket`, `ILiquidity`, etc.) to ensure ABI compatibility and safe interaction.
  - All router operations are parameterized to work with any Market instance.

- **Library Utilities:**
  - `RouterLibrary` in v1-periphery uses the core's interfaces to fetch reserves, compute pair IDs, and perform AMM math, always querying the Market contract for up-to-date state.

- **Payment Callbacks:**
  - The router implements the `IPayment` interface, allowing the Market contract to request tokens or liquidity as part of atomic operations (e.g., mint, burn, swap, flash).

### **Typical Flow Example**

```solidity
// Deploy the Market (from v1-core) and Router (from v1-periphery)
Market market = new Market(owner);
Router router = new Router(address(market));

// Add liquidity via the router (delegates to Market)
router.addLiquidity(
    token0, token1,
    1000e18, 500e18, 1000e18, 500e18, // amounts
    900e18, 400e18, 900e18, 400e18,   // minimums
    msg.sender,
    block.timestamp + 1 hours
);

// Swap tokens via the router (delegates to Market)
address[] memory path = new address[](2);
path[0] = token0;
path[1] = token1;
router.swap(100e18, 95e18, path, msg.sender, block.timestamp + 1 hours);

// Remove liquidity via the router (delegates to Market)
router.removeLiquidity(
    token0, token1,
    100e18, 50e18, 100e18, 50e18,
    90e18, 90e18,
    msg.sender,
    block.timestamp + 1 hours
);
```

- **All state-changing operations are ultimately performed by the Market contract in v1-core.**
- **The router provides user-friendly batching, validation, and payment handling, while the core enforces invariants and manages liquidity.**

## 🚦 Main Components

### Router.sol
- **addLiquidity/removeLiquidity**:  
  Add or remove liquidity to any pair, with slippage and deadline protection.
- **swap**:  
  Multi-hop swaps with minimum output and deadline checks.
- **quoteLiquidity/quoteReserve**:  
  Get LP token or reserve amounts for given inputs.
- **getAmountsIn/getAmountsOut**:  
  Path-based quoting for multi-hop swaps.
- **sweepNative**:  
  Withdraws any stuck ETH to a specified address.
- **requestToken/requestLiquidity**:  
  Payment callbacks for core contract integration.

### Libraries
- **RouterLibrary**:  
  - Path validation, token sorting, quoting, and AMM math.
  - Handles edge cases (zero reserves, unsorted tokens, invalid paths).
- **TransferHelper**:  
  - Safe ERC20 and ETH transfers, handling missing return values and reverts.
- **Math**:  
  - Full-precision multiplication/division for AMM calculations.

### Interfaces
- **IRouter**:  
  - Standard interface for all router operations.
- **IMarket**:  
  - Interface for the core Market contract.
- **ILiquidity**:  
  - Interface for LP tokens with long/short positions.
- **IPayment**:  
  - Callback interface for payment flows.
- **IERC20**:  
  - Minimal ERC20 interface for token operations.

### Abstracts
- **Deadline**:  
  - Modifier to enforce transaction deadlines and prevent stale operations.

## ✨ Usage Example

```solidity
// Deploy the Router with the Market address
Router router = new Router(address(market));

// Add liquidity
router.addLiquidity(
    token0, token1,
    1000e18, 500e18, 1000e18, 500e18, // amounts
    900e18, 400e18, 900e18, 400e18,   // minimums
    msg.sender,
    block.timestamp + 1 hours
);

// Swap tokens
address[] memory path = new address[](2);
path[0] = token0;
path[1] = token1;
router.swap(100e18, 95e18, path, msg.sender, block.timestamp + 1 hours);

// Remove liquidity
router.removeLiquidity(
    token0, token1,
    100e18, 50e18, 100e18, 50e18,
    90e18, 90e18,
    msg.sender,
    block.timestamp + 1 hours
);
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Foundry (if not already)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Clone the repo and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pennysia-v1-periphery.git
cd pennysia-v1-periphery
forge install

# Build and test
forge build
forge test -vvv
```

---

## Requirements

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) (for building and testing)
- Solidity 0.8.28
- Node.js (optional, for frontend integration)

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Comprehensive test suite using Foundry/Forge.
- Includes unit and integration tests for all router, library, and payment flows.
- Mocks for Market, Liquidity, and ERC20 contracts.

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with verbose output
forge test -vvv
```

---

## 🔒 Security

- **Slippage checks**: All liquidity and swap operations revert if minimums are not met.
- **Deadline enforcement**: Prevents stale transactions.
- **Safe transfers**: All token and ETH transfers use robust helper libraries.
- **Input validation**: Library functions revert on invalid paths, unsorted tokens, or zero amounts.
